# MHEI Stories

## Overview
This project is a web application that embeds ArcGIS story maps and provides navigation between different pages.

## Files
- `index.html`: The main landing page with the title "MHEI". It embeds a story map and has a custom navigation bar.
- `apaf.html`: Another page with the title "APAF". It embeds a different story map and also includes the custom navigation bar.
- `style.css`: Contains the styling for the website. It defines styles for the body, iframes, and navigation elements.
- `script.js`: Provides the interactivity for the navigation menu. It toggles the display of the menu and changes the state of the navigation button.
- `components.js`: Defines a custom web component (`custom-navbar`) used as a navigation bar.

## Usage
1. Open `index.html` in a web browser to view the main page.
2. Navigate between the main page and the "Alto Paran√° Atlantic forests" page using the custom navigation bar.

## Note
Make sure all files are in the correct directory structure as referenced in the HTML files for the site to work correctly.
